## 2023


## 2022
Finished days 1-6 and 8. Goal for 2023 to get farther.

I'm working in javascript to finsh this years AOC and learn new functions and processes. 

Initial reference to get started: [Youtube Video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um_-T8patWs)

Commented notes are in each day's section. Noteworthy learnings:
- .reduce when iterating through maps
- Set object, checks array for unique values
- .shift removes first element of array
  - .pop removes last element of array
- when you use .concat, it has to be saved into an already made array, or into a new one (day 5 part 2 issue)

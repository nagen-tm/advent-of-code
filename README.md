I'm working in javascript to finsh this years AOC and learn new functions and processes.

Commented notes are in each day's section. Noteworthy learnings:
- .reduce when iterating through maps
- Set object, checks array for unique values
- .shift removes first element of array
  - .pop removes last element of array

# advent-of-code
## 2023
Days finished: 1-4, part one of 5, 6

Language: Python

ToDo: 
- Study day 3 solutions to better understand comparison of index on different lines
- clean up earlier days to better use functions

Noteworthy Learnings:
- enumerate() adds a counter to iterate through easier
- day two use of split(), naming the data ahead of time instead of using the index 
- interesting [youtube video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGjAe6y299g) on recursion/loops

## 2022
Days finished: 1-6 and 8.

Language: Javascript

Initial reference to get started: [Youtube Video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um_-T8patWs)

Commented notes are in each day's section. Noteworthy learnings:
- .reduce when iterating through maps
- Set object, checks array for unique values
- .shift removes first element of array
  - .pop removes last element of array
- when you use .concat, it has to be saved into an already made array, or into a new one (day 5 part 2 issue)
